                <br> &emsp; I am a new sixth grade teacher at Park Avenue Elementary School. <span1>In the last few weeks, I have experienced things that a new teacher should never experience</span1>. It started back in December when I had my formal observation with the principal. My formal observation was on Friday December 9, 2022, at 8:30 am. A few days later we met for our post evaluation meeting. During our post evaluation meeting the principal reviewed my ratings. His ratings for standard 1e2 planning assessment criteria are effective, standard two classroom environment 2c1 is developing practice, standard three using assessment in instruction to advance student learning 3d3 is developing practice, and standard five professional growth 5a2 is effective. He reviewed his ratings with me and informed me that by the end of the day I could go on the platform and acknowledge it. I did so as soon as it was up on the platform.<br>
                <br> &emsp; Winter break begins and we go off for three weeks. Once Winter breaks ends, I return and receive two untitled letters from an office personnel. These two letters were from the assistant principal. These two letters were entitled and given to me by office personnel and not the assistant principal herself. One letter addressed the date of November 17, 2022. The second letter was dated November 8, 2022. My question is why I received these two letters' months later. I then responded to the assistant principal concerning these two letters and I have yet to hear from her and she has yet to pull me aside to talk to me about these two letters. The following week after receiving these two letters I got a note in my box from the principal saying that he would like to meet with me to go over a classroom observation of December 9, 2022, and that I was advised to bring my union rep. I was confused at why we were meeting again for my formal observation. My formal observation was on December 9, 2022. At this time, we had already had our post conference and I had acknowledged my ratings on the platform. At the time of the meeting, I did not realize that this was for my formal observation until the very end when I asked my rep, perplexed by their actions, why we would meet about formal again. In this meeting it was addressed that I was not developing or effective like he had mentioned weeks prior at our post conference. But on the contrary, it was quite the opposite.<br>
                <br> &emsp; Now, a week later, on January 19, I received yet another note from the principal asking me to see him. I went in that morning at 7:45am and he handed me a letter stating that I am currently being considered for non-selection as a District employee because of time I did not have a chance to speak to him about what this means exactly. I was really concerned and confused about what this meant. I met with him on Friday January 20th to get more information on what exactly this meant and what the basis was for me receiving this letter. The principal and I spent an hour and a half talking and I was left more confused and disappointed at the responses I received. The basis for receiving this letter according to him was my formal observation, memos, and informal observations. My formal observation when we met back in December for the post did not indicate that I was unsatisfactory and that is not what his ratings indicated either. So it was to my surprise that we were having a conference about my formal observation again and that now all my ratings have changed within a span of three weeks. I let the principal know that this was unfair and unjust. I never received any memos and have not been spoken to by either one of them.<span1> On top of not having been spoken to, I have also not received the support I need as a new teacher</span1>. As a new teacher I hoped that there would be support but unfortunately that has not been the case. Per my conversation with the principal, I had asked him to provide me with a list of dates, times, and types of support that the assistant principal and him have provided but I have yet to hear back from either one of them. The principal, during our hour and a half lengthy conversation, also made it clear to me that even developing or adhering to his directives would not change my status for non-reelection. He is taking away the opportunity for growth.<br>
                <br> &emsp; The principal congratulated me on my IABS scores. The students are making progress yet I am being told, by a single individual, that I am not doing my job. <span1>I have been informed that I can no longer be a teacher</span1>. That does not make sense.<br>
                <br> &emsp; <span1>Now weeks after</span1> receiving the letter of non-re-election and the continuous conversations between my UTLA rep and I the UTLA regional rep stepped in to help and address the situation with the administrator of director of schools. Based on their conversations the regional rep informed me that the administrator of director of schools <span1>admitted that under his watch the principal made a mistake</span1>. The principal made a mistake in how he dealt and proceed with the process. The administrator of director of schools acknowledged that the principal made a mistake in the way he handled the situation and proceeded with the process. <span1>Yet when he admitted to the mistake made no apology was given</span1>. Instead, he insisted to my UTLA regional rep that the best he could do for me is to <span1>“allow” me to resign</span1>. Isn’t that incredible? A higher up like the <span1>administrator of director of schools acknowledged that a mistake was made yet</span1> no apology was given nor was the non-re-election letter taken back. When is a <span1>mistake made then the letter should be</span1> taken back completely and the best the administrator of director of schools can do for me is allow me to resign? Resign why? And for what? I would be resigning my position for absolutely no reason. I do not believe it is fair for me to resign my position when <span1>I have done nothing wrong</span1>. It saddens me to witness first-hand just how much power administration and school directors have. They continuously preach “everything we do is for the students; we’re always thinking about the students” but in reality, they are not here for the students they are here for themselves. They would rather have me resign my position so that this could go away, and no further explanations would have to be given. All because they do not want to admit to their mistakes and fix them. This is not okay. This cannot stand and should not happen again to no other teacher or person. <span1>NO ONE</span1> should ever go through this nor should ever be put in a position where they must resign for no reason but only to cover up the mistakes of others have made. Mistakes made by individuals who are supposed to be leaders. Things must change. They <span1>NEED</span1> to change. The change must occur within LAUSD itself and with our legislators. The California Code needs be changed and reworded. As of now that California Code is too general that administrators like mine can hide behind it. That code is so general that it gives these administrators the power to use that code to push out new teachers.<br>
                <br> &emsp; Please help me make sense of this, I am undergoing a tremendous amount of stress and while I know the job is not easy it also should not be this stressful. I believe that the reasons for receiving this letter are unjust and nonfactual. I am pleading for help. I love what I do. My passion is teaching. I always do my best and always try to improve in any way that I can. I do what I do for the students. The students are why I am here, so I am asking you to support me. Help me find a solution to this matter. Administration and LAUSD need to be held responsible for their actions.<br>
